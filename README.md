# floating-point
Script to Perform Operations on Floating Points in a Bash Shell
as we can't perform floating point operations on shell using command line

The user will run this script and enter 3 parameters:</br>
    > The value of first operand </br>
    > The required operation </br>
    > The value of second operand</br>
